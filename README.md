# UniqeInt

UniqueInt is a solution to the "Unique Integers" programming assignment for Enterprise Web Development students. The script reads a list of integers from an input file, identifies unique integers, and generates an output file containing the sorted unique integers.

## Features

Reads a list of integers from an input file.
Identifies unique integers and removes duplicates.
Sorts the unique integers in increasing order.
Outputs the sorted unique integers to an output file.
Handles various input file formats and edge cases.
Provides memory usage and runtime information for each file processed.

## Usage

To use UniqueInt, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository or download the script file (UniqueInt.py).
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the script.
  Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python UniqueInt.py <input_file_path>
```

Replace `<input_file_path>` with the path to your input file.

## Sample Input

The input file should contain one integer per line, with optional whitespace characters before or after each integer.

For testing purposes, there are sample inputs saved in directory `sample_inputs`

## Sample Output

The output file will contain a list of unique integers sorted in increasing order, with one integer per line. The results have same name as the input with `_result` and saved in `sample_results` directory

## Requirements

Python 3.x
